# Joining and Combining Data  

## (A) Join Command  
Joining data from multiple sources allows correlation of events across different logs, enabling better analysis and threat detection.
  
```spl
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http 
| join src_ip [ search index=botsv3 sourcetype=firewall ]
```  
 Joins HTTP logs with firewall logs using `src_ip` as the common field.  

```spl
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4624 
| join Account_Name [ search index=botsv3 sourcetype=authentication_logs ]
```  
 Joins Windows Security login logs (`EventCode 4624`) with authentication logs on `Account_Name`.  

## (B) Append Command  
The `append` command is used to combine results from multiple searches without requiring a common field.

```spl
index=botsv3 sourcetype=firewall 
| append [ search index=botsv3 sourcetype=ids ]
```  
 Combines firewall and intrusion detection system (IDS) logs into one result set.  

```spl
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http 
| append [ search index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:dns ]
```  
 Merges HTTP traffic logs with DNS logs for correlation.  





## üîç Join vs Append: Key Differences
| Feature          | Join Command | Append Command |
|-----------------|--------------|---------------|
| Purpose         | Combines related data from two datasets based on a common field. | Stacks results from two datasets without requiring a common field. |
| Matching Field  | Required (must have a common field). | Not required. |
| Result Set      | Returns only matching records from both datasets. | Returns all results from both searches. |
| Performance     | Slower (can be resource-intensive). | Faster (as it doesn‚Äôt require field matching). |
| Use Case       | Used for correlating data. | Used for combining unrelated data. |

üöÄ **Use `join` for relational merging and `append` for stacking datasets!**
