# Advanced SPL for Security Use Cases

##  (A) Transaction Command (Grouping Related Events)

### (a) Grouping Failed Logins by Account Name
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security EventCode=4625
| transaction Account_Name maxspan=10m maxevents=5
```
Retrieves failed login attempts (EventCode 4625) for the same `Account_Name` within 10 minutes.

### (b) Tracking DNS Queries from the Same Source IP
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:dns
| transaction src_ip maxspan=5m
```
Groups DNS queries from the same `src_ip` if they occur within 5 minutes.

### (c) Identifying Data Exfiltration via HTTP Requests
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http
| transaction src_ip maxspan=2m maxevents=10
```
Groups multiple HTTP requests from the same `src_ip` within 2 minutes, possibly indicating data exfiltration.

## (B) Lookup Command (Enriching Data with External Intelligence)

### (a) Checking IPs Against a Threat Intelligence Lookup
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http
| lookup threat_intel src_ip OUTPUT risk_level
```
Enriches HTTP logs by checking `src_ip` against a threat intelligence list, returning a risk level.

### (b) Mapping Event Codes to Descriptions
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
| lookup eventcode.csv EventCode OUTPUT description
```
Matches Windows `EventCode` to a human-readable description from a lookup table.

### (c) Identifying Ransomware Extensions in File Operations
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:smb
| lookup ransomware_extensions file_extension OUTPUT category
```
Checks if file extensions match known ransomware indicators.

## (C) Risk Score Analysis (Prioritizing Security Events)

### (a) Assigning Risk Scores Based on HTTP Status Codes
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http
| eval risk_score = if(status="404", 10, 0)
```
Assigns a risk score of 10 to HTTP 404 errors, which may indicate scanning activity.

### (b) Risk-Based Authentication Analysis
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
| eval risk_score = if(EventCode=4625, 20, if(EventCode=4720, 50, 0))
```
Assigns 20 points for failed logins (4625) and 50 points for new user creation (4720).

### (c) Flagging High-Risk Firewall Traffic
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=firewall
| eval risk_score = case(action="blocked", 30, dest_port=3389, 50, 1=1, 0)
```
Assigns 30 points if traffic is blocked, and 50 points if it's targeting RDP (port 3389).

## (D) Threat Hunting (Searching for Indicators of Compromise - IoCs)

### (a) Searching for Malicious Source IPs
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:http
| search src_ip IN ("1.1.1.1", "2.2.2.2")
```
Searches for known malicious IPs in HTTP logs.

### (b) Hunting for Known Malicious Domains in DNS Logs
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=stream:dns
| search query IN ("badsite.com", "malicious.net")
```
Identifies DNS queries made to malicious domains.

### (c) Detecting Unauthorized Access from Compromised User Accounts
```splunk
index=botsv3 sourcetype=WinEventLog:Security
| search Account_Name IN ("admin", "hacker", "test")
```
Hunts for suspicious account activity using compromised user names.
